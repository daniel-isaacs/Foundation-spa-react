# RemkoJ.Foundation.Spa.ViewEngine
The SPA ViewEngine is one of the missing pieces (i.m.o.) to build a PWA/SPA on top of
[Episerver Foundation](https://github.com/episerver/foundation). This solution adds a
Microsoft ClearScript (V8) powered server side rendering engine to the PWA/SPA.

It's tested with the React based Episerver SPA, available from the same author.
